Good question 👍 — this is very important in Flexbox.

📌 flex: 1; in CSS

When you write:

flex: 1;


It is a shorthand for:

flex: 1 1 0%;


Which means:

flex-grow: 1;
flex-shrink: 1;
flex-basis: 0%;

📌 What Each Part Means
1️⃣ flex-grow: 1

The item will grow and take up available space.

If multiple items have flex: 1, they share space equally.

2️⃣ flex-shrink: 1

The item is allowed to shrink if needed.

3️⃣ flex-basis: 0%

Initial size is 0, so space is distributed evenly based on grow value.

📌 Example
<div class="container">
  <div class="box">1</div>
  <div class="box">2</div>
  <div class="box">3</div>
</div>

.container {
  display: flex;
}

.box {
  flex: 1;
}


👉 All 3 boxes will take equal width.

📌 If One Item Has More Grow
.box1 {
  flex: 2;
}

.box2 {
  flex: 1;
}


Now:

box1 takes 2 parts

box2 takes 1 part

So box1 is twice as wide.

📌 Simple Way to Remember

flex: 1 means:

"Take equal available space inside a flex container."

📌 When Is It Commonly Used?

Navbar items

Sidebar + content layout

Equal width columns

Cards layout
