Html



Css 
--I learned -- In margin if 3 values are given that mean top, left&right , bottom (margin: 100px auto 20px;)
--I learned -- to make a div center its not necessary to make it flex and center everytime, we can also do it using margin left and right = auto 
--I learned -- Flex:1 Means it will take full width (according to the video)


What is user select: none in css -- can set wheather a user can select or highlight the text on the webpage
